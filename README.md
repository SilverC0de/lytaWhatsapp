# snowbot
Snow is my personal assistant, so I am feeling lazy nowadays, I literally asked my sister to help me manage my account, send money, pay bills.

&nbsp;
### External libraries and services needed:
#### Eyowo
Eyowo offers programmable accounts, we'll just tap into their anointing

#### Pandorabots
We don't want Snow to bore us right, so let's use pandorabots üòÅüòÅ

#### Heroku
Snow should be online every time right? We need to host it, Heroku powers serverless applications, Let's use it

#### Netlify
Using Netlify to serve HTML pages, check it out https://snowbot.netlify.app

#### FaunaDB
So FaunaDB is a serverless DB as well, I guess I'm falling in love with serverless bitch*s

#### Termii
WhatsApp messaging service is needed and we need to use termii for that
```
Let's get started.
```

Before I proceed, Just know that I really sufferred in the hands of Facebook just to get my bot approaved.
